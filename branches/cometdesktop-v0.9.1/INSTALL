Comet Desktop - INSTALL
http://code.google.com/p/cometdesktop/


Quick and dirty install

(svn checkouts already link my svn external, so you can skip this step if you checked from svn)
download extjs v2.2 from http://extjs.com/
unzip/untar it as lib/ext-2.2 so that the adaptor directory is at lib/ext-2.2/adaptor/

edit .htaccess
set the COMETDESKTOP_ROOT to the root dir of the cometdesktop installation

import the database
$ echo 'create database cometdesktop' | mysql -u root mysql
$ mysql -u root cometdesktop < conf/install.sql

the default admin login is admin/admin

change the admin password
$ perl -MDigest::SHA1 -e 'print "Password:";my $p=<STDIN>;chomp($p);print Digest::SHA1::sha1_hex($p)."\n";'
# enter a new password, and copy the hash it printed out

# replace hash with the hash you just copied in this line, and run it
$ echo 'update qo_members set password="hash" where id=4' | mysql -u root cometdesktop

edit conf/desktop.conf to suit

main.conf just loads conf/desktop.conf, you can move
the conf dir out of your document root and change the path in main.conf
if you like
